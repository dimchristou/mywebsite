I am a Machine Learning Research, devising intuitive models for Natural Language Processing and Computer Vision problems.

*[intuitive]: “Intuition, [...] is the only tool left to the mathematician in the absence of proof.” Apostolos Doxiadis, Uncle Petros and Goldbach's Conjecture

I am studying [Computer Engineering](https://www.ece.ntua.gr/en) at [National Technical University of Athens](https://www.ntua.gr/en/).
My thesis is on graph-based sparsifications of [Attention layer](https://arxiv.org/abs/1706.03762).

I work as a researcher for [Explosion AI](https://explosion.ai/), the Machine Learning company behind [spaCy](https://spacy.io/).

I have been chosen to and completed successfully Google Summer of Code 2018, with my project [[1](http://www.nlpbuddy.io/gsoc), [2](https://github.com/eellak/gsoc2018-spacy)] for advancing Greek language understanding models.

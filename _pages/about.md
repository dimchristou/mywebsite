My name is Giannis Daras and I am a Machine Learning Researcher based on Greece.

I am currently last year student of ECE NTUA and I am applying for Machine Learning Ph.D., starting next year!


I work as Machine Learning Researcher for Explosion AI, the company behind spaCy.

My research is focused on improving the dense attention layer and solving inverse problems on GANs.

I have been successful student of Google Summer of Code 2018. Goal and outcome of my project [[1](http://www.nlpbuddy.io/gsoc), [2](https://github.com/eellak/gsoc2018-spacy)] was the integration of Greek Language to spaCy and the advancement of Greek NLP.

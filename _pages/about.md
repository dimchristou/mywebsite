I am a first year Computer Science Ph.D. student in UT Austin.
I am honored to be supervised by Prof. [Alexandros Dimakis](https://users.ece.utexas.edu/~dimakis/).
I received my undergraduate degree in ECE from National Technical University of Athens (NTUA).
During my undergraduate studies, I worked as a Machine Learning Researcher in ExplosionAI
and I successfully completed Google Summer of Code 2018.

I am interested in the theory and the applications of Machine Learning.
Recently, I have been publishing in attention networks and inverse problems for generative models.


I am starting a [blog](/blog)! I want to share:
(i) annotated pre-prints of my own work, (ii) interesting open-problems, (iii) annotated versions of other people's papers.
